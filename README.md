## Why I Stopped Working on It

I stopped updating Nameless Admin simply because I lost motivation. Life’s getting busier, and I’ve got other things to focus on. I’m growing up, and scripting just doesn’t fit into everything I’m trying to do right now.

It’s not because I disliked working on the project, or that the community was a problem — none of that. I actually enjoyed the experience and the support. But I want to spend more time on real-life priorities.

I’m also quitting Roblox in general. The updates lately feel soulless, and the platform just doesn’t interest me anymore. I’ve moved on.

Thanks to everyone who supported the project over the years. I appreciate it.
