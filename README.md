## Why I Stopped Working on It

I stopped updating Nameless Admin because I lost the motivation to continue. Life’s getting busier, and I’ve got real-world things to focus on. I’m growing up, and scripting just doesn’t really fit into where I’m headed anymore.

It wasn’t because I didn’t enjoy working on it, or because the community was an issue — none of that. I actually liked the process and the support. But I need to put more time into my personal life now.

I’m also done with Roblox in general. The updates lately feel soulless, and I’ve completely lost interest in playing. It’s just not for me anymore.

Thanks to everyone who supported the project — it really meant a lot.
